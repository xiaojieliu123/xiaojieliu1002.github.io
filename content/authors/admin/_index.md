Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate at the Economics Department of Northwestern University. My research agenda encompasses econometrics, (statistical) machine learning, and statistical decision theory, emphasizing identification, inference, and decision-making. In my work, I utilize ideas from these fields to contribute (new) solutions based on simple, reliable, and robust methods to methodological problems in economics.
