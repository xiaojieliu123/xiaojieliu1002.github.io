# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
 summary: 
# </a> In this paper we consider a risk-neutral firm that has an idea of unknown quality, but can perform an experiment to learn about it. The firm's goal is to decide the experiment's size and whether or not the idea should be implemented at scale after observing the experiment's outcome. We solve this problem using a Bayesian criterion (Gaussian Prior) and Minimax Regret criterion.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of identification in an IV model with missing data on the instrumental variable. I consider an agnostic stance on the distribution of the missing data and a worst case scenario approach to confront the missing data problem. First, I characterize the identified set of the parameter of interest and make explicit that this is an extremely complex object to compute. Next, following the literature on partial identification, I propose an outer identified set---a superset of the identified set that is easier to compute. Then, I show that, under some testable assumptions, this outer identified set is equal to the identified set.
