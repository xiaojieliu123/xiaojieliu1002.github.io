# </a> In this paper we consider a risk-neutral firm that has an idea of unknown quality, but can perform an experiment to learn about it. The firm's goal is to decide the experiment's size and whether or not the idea should be implemented at scale after observing the experiment's outcome. We solve this problem using a Bayesian criterion (Gaussian Prior) and Minimax Regret criterion.

Abstract: This paper proposes a local projection residual bootstrap method to construct confidence intervals for impulse response coefficients of AR(1) models. Our bootstrap method is based on the local projection (LP) approach and involves a residual bootstrap procedure applied to AR(1) models. We present theoretical results for our bootstrap method and proposed confidence intervals. First, we prove the uniform consistency of the LP-residual bootstrap over a large class of AR(1) models that allow for a unit root. Then, we prove the asymptotic validity of our confidence intervals over the same class of AR(1) models. Finally, we show that the LP-residual bootstrap provides asymptotic refinements for confidence intervals on a restricted class of AR(1) models relative to those required for the uniform consistency of our bootstrap.
