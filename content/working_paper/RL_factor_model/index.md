summary: joint with José Luis Montiel Olea.
# </a> In this paper we consider a risk-neutral firm that has an idea of unknown quality, but can perform an experiment to learn about it. The firm's goal is to decide the experiment's size and whether or not the idea should be implemented at scale after observing the experiment's outcome. We solve this problem using a Bayesian criterion (Gaussian Prior) and Minimax Regret criterion.

Abstract: In this work, we analyze recent theoretical developments in the representation learning literature through the lens of a linear Gaussian factor model. First, we derive *sufficient representations*---defined as functions of covariates that, upon conditioning, render the outcome variable and covariates independent. Then, we study the theoretical properties of these representations and establish their  *asymptotic invariance*; which means the dependence of the representations on the factors' measurement error vanishes as the dimension of the covariates goes to infinity. Finally, we use a decision-theoretic approach to understand the extent to which representations are useful for solving *downstream tasks*. We show that the conditional mean of the outcome variable given covariates is an asymptotically invariant and sufficient representation that can solve *any* task efficiently, not only prediction.
